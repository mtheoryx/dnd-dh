### Beginning Tasks

Do we know WHY the gazers are being used or who controls them?

### Adventure Notes

- We smoosh the kenku
- We get the stone of Golar - River grabs it
	- rolls percentile rolls (d100)
	- 57/49
	- Succeed in grabbing the stone, puts in pocket	
- We fight a multi-color-beaming eye creature
	- Rainbow
	- Translucent (frost?)
	- Blue (wis save?)
- [[Squiddy]] tries to run
	- Persuasion check fail, keeps running
	- Quinn tries to grapple him, with disadvantage (strength melee attack/unarmed strike [[TODO]])
	- Didn't work, he runs, we move downstairs, see all kids running away
- Quinn searches around and finds a stick
	- 12 inches long, notched spiral (rings) every 1 inch, circular top, 2 reverse thorns away from bottom, flat circular top
	- Present to group, I have no idea. And they don't either. Rubi tries to break it
	- Already has a crack running through it. Magic stuff doesn't break?
	- Quinn keeps it anyway
	- [[The old tower number 1]] for reference
	- Should get it looked at, at some point [[Goals]]
- Portal
	- Teleportation circle? Can it be a source and destination?
	- It's inert/inactive so far
- We should tell Reineer about the stone
	- Decide to not short rest, we just go
- We attempt to travel home and short rest
	- We want to check in on the spell book for Zavari
	- We want to do a short rest
	- We decide we will take the stone with us to talk to reineer
- Ambush by goblins, bugbear, Intellect Devourer, take a beating
- Then we rest at manor (4:30am)
	- Collect some gold, some daggers
	- 5cp, 15gp (*8)
	- 2g, 5s, 6c each after party split
	- Random bullshit, not in great shape, not worth anything
	- Cannot take long rest (because we already woke from one), we take short rest instead, 2am next day is first long-rest we can take
	- We aren't leaving it behind, at all, because it could be discovered/stolen
	- River hears "I can show you where it is" [[Stone of Golar]]
	- Stone is definitely magical
		- Rubi detects
		- Gets an illusion?
		- Quinn senses undead, is that the ghost I'm picking up?
- Rubi attunes to the stone of Golar [[Stone of Golar]]
	- Take another short to attune to it
	- Not cursed
	- Stone talks openly to Ruby, referrs to talking to Zavari
	- Changes that happen on attunement:
		- appearance (forced): Rubi changes to Looks like 6' human
		- 3 charges a day to cast legend lore (1d3 recharge at dawn) holds total of 3 charges
		- Can cast viscious mockery at will
