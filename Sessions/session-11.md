Too close to long rest, but we take a short and spend hit die for some points

We short rest at Blackstaff tower

We already got one key, the severed drow hand

Rubi's legend lore told us some deets on the dragon!
	- Arinax friend to Ma'aril who last wielded dragon staff adharyon, friend of Arinax
	- Dragon was invited to stay in Dragon Tower, for a short time, before the Spell Plague
	- [[Baruk Klanghamer]], elderly dwarf, a form he often assumes

Post short rest:

Let's locate an adamantite bar? Or the dwarven cask of ale? To the market!

Not selling adamantite bars, but selling ale
Bars are blacksmith inquiry-only for source or stock
	- Who do we know?
Hit up the Market first, 
	- Ale cask: 5gb
	- Rubi tastes to verify authenticity on 1d100
Blacksmith by the manor
	- Water and Fire Genasi
	- Super friendly, happy about the work on the manor
	- Water Genasi is super friendly, fire genasi likes hearing about our free drinks
	- Ask about a bar of adamantite, how soon do we need it?
	- Cash? 1,000 gold. Wow.
Back to trollskull
	- 3rd think is a ton of money, and we need all the keys to get the money
	- Zavari: Pull a favor from reineer, we are owed it
	- We were discussing an option of town guard or grey hands, but didn't decide
	- Ask for help because the 3rd is out of our reach?
We talk to reineer
	- Won't have to worry about the stone
	- Has to ask contacts about adamantite bar (prefer to not spend th 1,ooo GP first)
	- We are calling in a favor, officially
	- Take about a day or so to ask around, he's in seaward our goal is southwest of them, so we request a runner
Poker game, for fun, at his home, with buy-in (20gp), starts in 3 hours
	- We stay for dinner and game (we all do for dinner)
	- It's 3 in the afternoon, we're in
	- [[Volkarr Kibbens]] and [[Flunn]] show up to the game
	- Quinn decides to play with a strategy of "bluffing" and read the table? Charisma attribute, which shits the bed
	- Volo wins final hand with a huge bluff! We're congratulatory, all jovial
	- We crash on couches
Long Rest it up, but do the watch thing
	- Last watch, Quinn, all clear
Knock at the door, letter to reineer
	- Antichamber, has the item (the adamantite rod)
We ask about bringing in authorities
	- Confirmed from reineer, embezzled money
	- Who do we trust?
	- First, you are part of force grey. Trust Vadra, she can speak to lords of waterdeep
	- Suggestions, or wait for them?
		- We say finders fee. He says 1/5th is fair.
		- There could be nothing there, and we don't know what even is there.
		- He finds it interesting that we even found any of this.
We have all 3 keys, what next?
	- We get an audience with Vadra in her office, explain the thing
	- We ask for 1/5th of "the thing", she "might" do it, answer isn't today, but probably not a problem
	- If you are ready to move, she says, go ahead and make it happen
	- Can we have some help?
		- Can send maloon with us, he would agree
		- He joins! With Azure Edge
		- We warn we are going to open a vault, perhaps involving a gold dragon
		
Gambling
	- 20gp buy-in
	- Quinn learned why paladin's don't gamble

Pink Building, theater
	- Show ends 9pm
	- Currently late afternoon
	- Show force grey badge for access, maloon does a little belt flex
	- We say we are searching for an entrance? Hecc. Get led to back stage
	- 18" long dragon with butterfly wings, sparkles being tossed overe, performers pose after. It's a real dragon! wtf?
	- Faerie Dragon! (Pseudo Dragon)
		- Violet in color
	- Find and operate trap door (thanks to Zavari's knock spell)
	- We go in!

Vault!
	- 20 high, 20 wide door, bearing dwarven runes (Quinn speaks dwarven)
	- "The Three Keys, bring them forth" (quinn shares, because speaks)
	- Doors open up, we proceed, worried about traps
	- 12 sets of double doors, dwarven warriors in plate armor
	- "Wand of secrets", river has it

We explore the sets of doors. They're stuck to the wall. Made of iron. We ask the Stone of Golar, the stone don't know.

However West doors, middle, are false. Able to slide open, and see a secret passage.

And River and Maloon are like charmed by the fresco on the wall
	- Quinn attacks the fresco
	- River and maloon are compelled to defend it
	- Quinn smites it, and the "charm" seems removed

Out of combat, River and Maloon are out of the daze, and we end the episode!
