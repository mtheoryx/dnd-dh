### Adventure Notes

We are going upstairs
Warhammer carvings sitting upside down on the floor, pillars
Cracked mozaic, dwarf smith crafting dwarves out of black metal and diamonds
Crumbling bridges, we don't know the span
Secret door
Green copper urns, 5 of them
Overflowing with coins, we tip over the first

Dwarf treasure:
5 oxidized copper urns
1: 100gold Tormaline, egg-size, type of semi-precious gem, 200c
2: 650 silver, 11 gold rings
3: Gold
4: 10gp gemstones
5: 250g, 10lb statue, dwarf priestess, amethyst eyes

Rubi uses grape seeds from Maloon to reinforce the bridge with vines
Adamantine door on the other side (all 3) and 2 separate doors
We probably need to check each one
Door appears locked, magically, magical runes
Knock works, we go in room 1
Hammer, inscription in dwarvish: Let hearts be lifted and battles be won
I strike the anvil
10 temp hp for everyone in the room

Attempt at door 2: 

Rubi makes a bridge as a giant spider with webbing
4 suits of rusted armor, sans helms
Dwarvish runes

> A secret never before told will part doomathorn's lips

Dwarven diety of secrets

Quinn tells the secrets of his deep seated hatred of the cowards who surrendered his city as a child

Maloon consoles me for my embarassment sharing that

Spiral staircase opens

Red and gold dragon intwined staff, old dwarf "Perhaps you should come back later"

The staff allows him to be in waterdeep, given by neverember, who is currently in neverwinter

Appealing to morality, we try to help, and we persuade to reduce our take from 20% to 10% in return for living, and helping us get the stuff out

Swallows stuff, and takes us outta here

Name: Aranax (prefer that we call them Barrak, and not mention they are a dragon)

Time: 1pm

Vadra relays message, they agreed to our terms of 20%

Arynax is back, ready to deposit the loot. Where should we put it

Basement or main room? Basement, we decided, and we will stand on guard overnight until the morning and tell them to come get their share

500,000 gold pieces (10,000 lbs of gold)
He will come back tomorrow for his portion (10%)
So, 80% to town: 400,000

10: to us 50,000
10: to Aranax 50,000

Take a full rest.

Each: 10,000 Gold, let's shop!

Quinn:

- [x] 2 immovable rods (249, 349)
- [x] Adamantine Armor, plate, +1 (5,740)
- [x] Ring of Water Walking (421)

- [x] Cloak of protection (497)

5gp

New Campaign! Dungeon of the mad mage

Nitherel? Holaster brought 7 apprentices. Tapped into power to summon other planes to help build wizard tower to dwarf other towers.

Construction beneath the tower. Kept a secret from the 7. Eventually broke into a mithral mine underneath. Mirikan clan have been dispersed.

Extra-planar allies. Drow left to fight alone. Trapped souls, twisted bodies and souls. Delving deeper, in compulsion to dive deeper in the mountain (under mountain)

Air of unconceivable madness. Apprentices came and left, draw to the undermountain diving obsessions.

As the city sprawled outward, it came to surround the ruins. Criminals were sent as punishment.

Duran, returned alive. Demolished the tower. Built the yawning portal. Owns and operates. Invites and teases new and old to venture and test their metal.

Uday is looking for any magic items from undermountain, we can sell, we don't know the details, but is open for unwanted stuff.

We find Obaya Uday at the yawning portal

Rubi is trying like hell to get rid of the stone of golar, and offload it to Uday. Technically was a magic item from undermountain?

Quinn would have rather had it to attune to, but Adi/Rubi was adament about not letting that happen.

10p: Common
50p: Uncommon
500p: Rare
5000p: Very Rare
Spellbooks, paid based on highest level in the book


Talk to volo, he's pumping for answers, we don't tell about the dragon
Quinn, take a gold, to bet against us
Looking for something
Last Colonel, disappeared from where the mad mage built tower
Stone craft, alabaster throne, stolen from elves from under the dwarves noses
Quest! Find it, get it, or note where it is
Monsters? Unique, catalog them for Volo

Quinn goes down first, pays a gold

Bets start happening, 2:1 over a 10 day coming back all alive

I hear chanting that follows me down, "in the well", takes 10 minutes to lower

Hit the bottom:

- 40 by 40 exit on sw corner
- sandy floor, thin layer, hanging shields
- Elvish, I don't speak it, but I could recognize it

Nurel: Woman in cloak, mask over face, says "Would you be willing to find someone while you're down there? 22yo man, dark skin, signet ring (diving white falcon on field of blue)" Family crest. If you can find him, House Rosnar, you can trust.

We have all arrived at the bottom, and we break for the night.
