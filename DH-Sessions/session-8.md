## Notes

### Beginning Tasks

- The group has split up into 2 teams. Quinn and shape-shifted Rubi in one group, Zavari, River, and Dochas in another.
- At the finesmith's, Quinn has just purchased a better quality lock with 6 keys (100g) for the group's treasury chest.
- If we find the Stone of Golar, we keep what we find, treasure included. Reineer merely wants to keep it out of the hands of a faction for fear of the resulting power imbalance that would unfold.

### Adventure Notes

- For the transaction, we see a ledger book used. Quinn's address is taken and noted, and fingerprint taken in melted wax. It appears to be a one-per-page receipt book. It's placed under the table, easily distinguished from other books.
- Quinn is "running a distraction" looking at and talking about door locks, giving Rubi a chance to have a peek in the book. The writing is Dwarvish, which Quinn speaks, but Rubi needs to just try to memorize it for later.
- We meet back up at the fogotten lantern, and Rubi describes to Quinn what they saw. Dochas and Zavari regroup there as well.
- The name entry for the shiny silver key with the mark: [[Volkarr Kibbens]], the address is [[The Old Windmill]] in the [[Southern Ward]]
- We travel to the windmill. It's run down, crumbling, squatters have taken over. After persistance, one of the squatters mentions 2 "unusual and loud" tennants in the 2nd story. They are Ballaskan Tufts? They have the tower to themselves.
- We head up to investigate, use the key to unlock it, and the 2 try to escape out the window immediately.
- From interrogation, we learn a necromancer, Losser Mirklav, is underground with 2 apprentices, Retchyn? and Areela? The entrance is via the cellar inside the Dandy Maps Wig Shop in the Trade Ward
- We sneak to and into the shop in the dark of early morning, head down below. One encounter in a side room takes place and resolves, still no sign of Losser Mirklav.

### Ending Tasks

- Still in initiative
- We've opened the door to another room. There appear to be 2 other factions fighting each other. Kenku and skeletons. Surprises await! 
- We're after the necromancer, still searching for the Stone of Golar.
