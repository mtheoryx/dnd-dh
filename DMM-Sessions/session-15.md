## Notes

### Goals to remember

- [ ] Catalog new monsters for volo in the yawning portal, we have to take time to catalog them, which means writing down details. And only new monsters! But what do we know as new?? (Someone knows/read the volo book?)
- [ ] Last Colonel, disappeared from where the mad mage built tower
Stone craft, alabaster throne, stolen from elves from under the dwarves noses, find it or note where it is

### Beginning (recap)

- We finish any buying on the surface
	- Sell the globe, adjust currency and split to the party
	- Every one gets +1 to currency in platinum
- We get in a position to take a long rest
- We dive back into the yawning portal

We killed manticors and a troll!
Found mess halls. A temple
