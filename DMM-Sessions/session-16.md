## Notes

### Goals to remember

- [x] Get the loot (carrying the stone)
- [ ] Who's this ghost in our house?
- [x] Pay off the house loan
- [ ] Open the tavern
- [x] Prepare to spend the money? Pick some items
- [ ] Do a dive in the Yawning Portal, survive, find magic items for [[Obaya Uday]], rewards offered
- [ ] Woman in cloak, mask over face, says "Would you be willing to find someone while you're down there? 22yo man, fair skin, platinum signet ring (diving white falcon on field of blue)" "Fly high and stoop swift" Family crest. If you can find him, House Rosnar, you can trust.
- [ ] Catalog new monsters for volo in the yawning portal, we have to take time to catalog them, which means writing down details. And only new monsters! But what do we know as new?? (Someone knows/read the volo book?)
- [ ] Last Colonel, disappeared from where the mad mage built tower
Stone craft, alabaster throne, stolen from elves from under the dwarves noses, find it or note where it is

### Beginning (recap)

- Possibly taking a short rest. 
- The mimic was real, the golden spear was not.
- Took the south route marked "certain death this way" with big arrow pointing that way
- Found a bronze statue with inscription
	- Thought the thing required was somewhere else
	- But the way we chose were clean
	- Gelatenous cube somewhere near there?
- Monolith with a big eye on top of it, caught in the swinging trap (quinn?)
- Map of undermountain with symbols and buttons
- Pit with a sheer side, found a revenant, killed by his party, traveling with us
- Secret of dwarven statue, 2nd head grafted to it, raise it, found a circlet underneath
- Raided former smithy, found some treasure
- Opened current t-shaped room, found a mimic
- And we killed the mimic and that is where we left off last week

### Adventure Notes

Use 2 immovable rods to block off a hallway for us to take a short rest

We find a bunch of blood-suckers in a room and say fuck that, and leave the area

We find a whole goblin market

Sell 120 dwarven iron ingets

Paid in silver: 252 silver total to the treasury box (Rubi)

Metal isn't the easiest to get down here in raw form

Skull port (a human town down here?)

Goblins control the north, don't travel to south. Humans and dark eleves to the south.

"ScratchRock" the merchant we sold iron to, has a legit +1 shield, 1500gp.

Has "Yuk" asked to see you? Area to the SE of the market

We take door south out of market, find magically animated frescos, harry potter style

Fighting Xanathars and multiple traps. We're taking hits, burnign resources. We see a dark elf step out, male dark elf

8 red arachnid eyes, mouth full of fangs, black bristles from his slender arms.
