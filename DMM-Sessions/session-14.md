## Notes

### Goals to remember

- [x] Get the loot (carrying the stone)
- [ ] Who's this ghost in our house?
- [x] Pay off the house loan
- [ ] Open the tavern
- [x] Prepare to spend the money? Pick some items
- [ ] Do a dive in the Yawning Portal, survive, find magic items for [[Obaya Uday]], rewards offered
- [ ] Woman in cloak, mask over face, says "Would you be willing to find someone while you're down there? 22yo man, fair skin, platinum signet ring (diving white falcon on field of blue)" "Fly high and stoop swift" Family crest. If you can find him, House Rosnar, you can trust.
- [ ] Catalog new monsters for volo in the yawning portal, we have to take time to catalog them, which means writing down details. And only new monsters! But what do we know as new?? (Someone knows/read the volo book?)
- [ ] Last Colonel, disappeared from where the mad mage built tower
Stone craft, alabaster throne, stolen from elves from under the dwarves noses, find it or note where it is

### Beginning (recap)

- Still in the under dark
- Do we find our way back? Do we continue further?
- Do we short rest for anyone who can benefit from it?
- We did not go down the certain death hallway
- We did not got down the mirrow hallway
- Wyvern, shards of glass, in that room was also a throne made of bones, snake heads as hand rests

### Adventure Notes

Encounter more bandits in the throne room, Dochas takes out most with a fireball

Timestamp (00:23:00) for reference of incident start

- Zvari is holding an action for anyone around the corner
- Rubi is up, cant see anything, summons critter (interjected turn from DM)
- creature surrenders in front of River, drops to knees
- Rubi can't see anything
- Quinn is up next, moves to critter (double move, to right next to surrending person), end of turn
- Dochas recalls sunforger (as an action), and moves to keep an eye down a hallway
- River moves, points with quarter staff "are there any more of you, are you the last one", "I don't know" that's the last answer, River holds a whack as an action
- Zavari moves into view, sees 5 bodies around. Holds an action for eldritch blast. He is on his knees with hands on head. (Does not count as prone).
- Not in combat anymore.
- Quinn heard an ask and no info. Party what do we do?
	- Dochas wants to ask more
	- Rubi: It's a gang, they were robbing people
	- Quinn: Who do you report to? "Haria" the one we killed.
	- Rubi: This is the part where we just kill him
	- Zavari is also questioning why I wouldn't kill him.
	- River is also questioning why I wouldn't kill him.
	- He speaks up and says "Nothing we did is illegal, there are no laws down here"
	- Quinn: "No authority/laws, so, if we want to axe them..." tries to make another excuse to not kill them
	- Dochas tries to reason, "go to the surface, find a real job, that doesn't consist of robbing people"
	- DM Confirmed he was one who fired a crossbow at me
	- Zavari: He's a bad guy, what do we do to bad guys?
	- Quinn: I'm a little morally opposed, but says it could be "paladin look away" and okay with it
	- On his last legs, Zavari wants to just do it, tell us to look away
	- Argument starts with Dochas, Zavari, Rubi, River
	- Quinn: I have another idea. Quinn likes the "let em go", but also asks for a meat shield. He refuses.
	- Party argues the nuance of that arrangement, presents cautions. Zavari: Take him out now, let me do it, turn around paladins. Rubi also talks sense regarding all the ones we killed.
	- Quinn listens, and then in the middle of disputes: DM question, I didn't stow the sun sword, right? "No, it's out"
	- Quinn attacks. Knocks prone. Then on 2nd attack, kills him.
	- We see him turn into the blue-ish doppleganger.

This will cause paladin conflict, particularly with Dochas, per VB saying so?


Slender throne green helmet, with visor

Eventually, we find a mantacore, wtf is this?

Haria, boss the gang reports to, we killed them.

We were down there for 4 hours. So we aren't up to a long rest. We could leave, of course. We can.

Stay here or go up? Could buy potions, could get curse lifted. Could do stuff for a while and get to a long rest. Also the curse mirrors?

Rubi wants to go up for the curse lift. Quinn wants to buy potions.

You gotta put a gold piece in first! Quinn pays it. Zavari does too. It's 1 gold per person who needs the lift up or down. Only Quinn and Dochas need this service, both ways.

Some win, some lose, and one got a jackpot "One of them has a curse!"

Once we are up...

Obaday has a room here. Rubi is still a giant spider form "that's disconcerting". But shapeshifts back to normal form. We did not catalog any monsters, so that is out the window. Lessons were learned!

We want to offer a magic heart (she isn't interested). All it does is kill person attuned to it, not interested. Drift globe? quinn isn't attached to it.

Remove curse cost? (150g). Rubi says no, let's go to Dochas temple to try to get it for free? They don't do it for free for someone other than Dochas. Not free anymore.

River suggests talking to the Grey Hands, we have enough clout to get it done. 6 notches in the org. We leave the sword and the heart, we don't know what else can be done with with it. 

Quinn buys health potions for team! 50gp each, 2d4+2 potions. Buys all 8 he can get (leaving a little leftover) even though others are buying their own.

8 healing distributed to team, quinn already had 5 of them, so spend for the team.

Distribution:

- 2 to River
- 2 to rubi
- 2 to zavari
- 2 to dochas

### Ending Tasks

- We finish any buying on the surface
- We get in a position to take a long rest
- We dive back in
