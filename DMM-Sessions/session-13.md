### Adventure Notes

We land at the bottom of the yawning portal entrance, we go down the hall
After hearts are drawn on the wall, we go down the hall

We find a sword, examine properties, it's magical weapon, rubi picks it up and packs it away. Rewards for magical items?

Rubi can't let go of the grip though, hand won't open to let it go. Orc hand cut off at the wrist, oh hell.

Eminates dim light, but Rubi can't let go of it.

Initiative at the T-shape, we have a fight. Rubi saw something and quick jumped back. We see a bugbear.

Into the sewers! Sahagan, in the water, statue. head turned around, arm broken off, radiating dim purple light

Water is murky sewer water, and gets deeper. Quinn can walk on water. Checks out the alcove, and takes a psychic sledge hammer to the head. We abandon this investigation, and leave.

Encounter a grell! River paralyzed and grappled. 

If a spell has a S component, you need to have a hand free to cast it, so you need to drop it, or use a focus (like your shield) if it's your holy symbol. As per p144, 1 hand for shield, pg 146 need a hand to use the sword, 203 need a hand for a Somatic spell. This is a mechancial drawback, we are not very ranged.

Encounter vampyres. They "look vampire-ey" lol. Quinn senses no undead lmao. They are demanding a toll to proceed. Cheri has some gold... it's burning hands.

We have a flood of additional fake-vampire bandits, Dochas critting once every damn turn like a boss.

This is where the confusion around "add smite" before damage came up, you can wait till you hit. But you can wait to see that it "hits" on the attack. You must declare adding smite for the attack damage.

Thrones, armrests resemble a fanged snake, bones of a dead wyvern and shards of clear crystal.

Learning moment, courtesy of Adi: Take an attack, use the bonus action for shield master to knock prone, make 2nd attack at advantage.


### Ending Tasks

We leave off in a room, down yonder. We pick it up next week!
